# Quaternion Editor

Quaternion Editor is a web-based tool that allows you to visualize and manipulate rotations using quaternions. It uses Three.js to render a 3D cube with text labels on each face, making it easy to understand the orientation of the cube and calculate quaternion values.

## Installation

To use the Quaternion Editor, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/QuaternionEditor.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd QuaternionEditor
```

### Step 3: Open the `index.html` file

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser or host the project on a local server.

## Usage

1. Use the sliders or input fields to adjust the rotation values for X, Y, and Z axes.
2. The 3D cube will update in real-time to reflect the changes in rotation.
3. Click the "Calculate Quaternion" button to view the corresponding quaternion values for the current rotation.
4. Explore different rotations and their quaternion representations using the visual editor.

## Live Demo

You can try out the Quaternion Editor live at [skyyyr.github.io/QuaternionEditor](https://skyyyr.github.io/QuaternionEditor).

## Technologies Used

- Three.js: for 3D rendering
- JavaScript: for scripting interactivity
- HTML/CSS: for the user interface
